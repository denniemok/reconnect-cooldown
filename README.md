### Introduction
This is a minimalist plugin with exactly one function: cooldown any reconnections. Nothing fancy or complicated is involved. It only does the simplest task you ask for, and hence the performance.

This plugin is especially useful if you have installed some heavy plugins that do a lot of loadings on join events. Frequent reconnection not only floods the chat with join messages but might also cause trouble for some plugins. This plugin aims to provide a solution to this issue by introducing a cooldown on reconnections.

Originally being part of [BattleAsya Utility](https://github.com/denniemok/battleasya-utility), this component is now made available separately with enhanced configurability.
